#Medicine Reminder 

Create software for a hospital system to remind patients via SMS when they need to take certain medicines. Imagine that your data is structured in a CSV in the following fashion:


You should:
1. Sign up for a Twilio account and create a new project. Use test credentials so your account is not charged.
2. Set up a local development environment. We recommend using the Twilio Python library but you may work in whatever language you feel most comfortable with.
3. Write a script to send reminders via SMS using Twilio's Programmable SMS API. The script should query the database for when patients need to take certain medicines and send a reminder message to the customer's phone number using the Twilio API. The message should include the medicine name and dosage.
